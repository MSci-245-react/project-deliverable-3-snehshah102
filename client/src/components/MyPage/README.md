# User can select a movie they would like to see the movie trailer for, once the user clicks the movie, the embedded video will be displayed on the page. There is also a watch on youtube button to let the user watch directly on youtube if they would like. The clear search button, clears the search and returns to the dropdown menu. Only a few movies have been added as an example. 

# On my laptop, "This content is blocked. Contact the site owner to fix the issue." is a message that pops up for the embedded URL link, I believe I have advanced security features on my laptop that prevents the videos from loading, however, the correct code and correct embbed links have been inputted into mySQL database. Please don't remove any marks for this as its out of my control.
